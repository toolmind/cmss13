changes:
  - balance: "Huggers get activated sooner now, from a minimum of 5 seconds to a max of 15 seconds, to 3.5 seconds and 7 seconds. They still have an average lifespan of 30 seconds after activation, though"
  - balance: "Huggers can only hug the person next to them rather from 3 tiles away"
  - balance: "Huggers now have 5 tries to jump at someone, from only having 2 tries"
  - balance: "All xenos now have a cooldown on dropping or throwing facehuggers"
  - balance: "Carriers can now throw their stored facehuggers farther with their throw facehugger ability, from a range of 3 tiles to 6 tiles, nearly screenwide"
  - balance: "Carrier facehugger throwing is much faster, from 2 seconds to 5 deciseconds, much faster than the standard xeno cooldown"
  - balance: "Carrier facehugger retrieval from their storage now has a 5 decisecond cooldown, matching their throw cooldown"
  - code_imp: "Facehugger throw range is no longer hardcoded to 1, but its range switches to 1 if the mob is a xenomorph. You can now throw dead facehuggers at your friends, rather than it landing pathetically next to you"
  - code_imp: "Kills some single letter variables in facehugger and carrier.dm"
  - refactor: "Refactors carrier throw facehugger code a bit slightly"
  - refactor: "Some minor reorganization of files for cleanliness"
  - rscdel: "Removes some defunct and unused variables"
