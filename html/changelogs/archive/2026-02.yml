  - mapadd: Tyrargo Rift has been added to the game. Set in the midst of a large-scale
      armed conflict between the United American military and a Xenomorph hive on
      a temperate but highly populated world. Expect a blend of open arena combat
      and urban close quarter battle in a multiz-level environment.
  - mapadd: A large set of nightmare inserts for Tyrargo Rift have been added. These
      includes random structure changes and new combat environments.
  - rscadd: Elements of the US Army's 1st Air Cavalry can be found defending the city
      and outskirts of Tyrargo Rift. This includes a US Army Major and a US Army Synthetic.
  - imageadd: Addition of a large amount of new prop sprites, including military and
      civilian vehicles, static emplacements, aircraft, environmental flora such as
      trees, and urban props such as tents, illuminator lights or wooden boards.
  - admin: A US Army ERT has been added, however, this ERT is not intended to be deployed
      as part of a Distress Signal.

      helmets, patches and symbols, some of which are ported from the PvE CM-SS13
      server, others are custom sprites.

  - rscadd: New water flood system has been added for Tyrargo. This allows the Marines
      to flood the lower sewers, and for xenomorphs to undo this by breaking the appropriate
      APC which will cause the water to recede. The flooding and receding will display
      an animation and will push around loose objects that are caught in the flooding.
      This new system has been retrofired for Trijent Dam's flooding.
