changes:
  - mapadd: "Tyrargo Rift has been added to the game. Set in the midst of a large-scale armed conflict between the United American military and a Xenomorph hive on a temperate but highly populated world. Expect a blend of open arena combat and urban close quarter battle in a multiz-level environment."
  - mapadd: "A large set of nightmare inserts for Tyrargo Rift have been added. These includes random structure changes and new combat environments."
  - rscadd: "Elements of the US Army's 1st Air Cavalry can be found defending the city and outskirts of Tyrargo Rift. This includes a US Army Major and a US Army Synthetic."
  - imageadd: "Addition of a large amount of new prop sprites, including military and civilian vehicles, static emplacements, aircraft, environmental flora such as trees, and urban props such as tents, illuminator lights or wooden boards."
  - admin: "A US Army ERT has been added, however, this ERT is not intended to be deployed as part of a Distress Signal."
  - rscadd: "US Army flavoured equipment has been added. Including armour, uniforms, helmets, patches and symbols, some of which are ported from the PvE CM-SS13 server, others are custom sprites."
  - rscadd: "NPC Xenomorphs will no longer target monkeys, rats or mice."
  - code_imp: "Framework to facilitate map specific ERTs to be called automatically once a round has ended, and for automatic USCM high command and queen mother messages to be sent, have been added. This is currently used for Tyrargo Rift, but the code can be used for any other map."
  - bugfix: "Fixed several errors that occur if NPC Xenos attempt to cross z-levels or enter tents."
  - rscadd: "A set of new atmospheric audio files have been added for Tyrargo Rift."
  - rscadd: "A set of xeno NPC, and ammunition, spawner landmarks has been added for mappers. The spawn chance is set by a variable on the spawner, allowing mappers to set these items to have a random chance to appear on the map."
  - rscadd: "New water flood system has been added for Tyrargo. This allows the Marines to flood the lower sewers, and for xenomorphs to undo this by breaking the appropriate APC which will cause the water to recede. The flooding and receding will display an animation and will push around loose objects that are caught in the flooding. This new system has been retrofired for Trijent Dam's flooding."
  - rscadd: "Sticky resin and reinforced xeno wall/door spawners for the Distress Signal gamemode has been added for mapper use. This will spawn these objects only during the aforementioned gamemode."
