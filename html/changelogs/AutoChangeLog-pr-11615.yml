changes:
  - refactor: "Reverted Xeno Fire Immunity Refactor and did it a different way: Xenos now define fire_immunity per xeno rather than per caste, always are registered to fire signals, and handle ignition in IgniteMob proc."
  - balance: "Hive buff for fire immunity will now stop even fire penetration."
  - balance: "Burning clouds now do no damage if the xeno has FIRE_IMMUNITY_NO_DAMAGE instead of half damage."
  - bugfix: "Fixed messages about burrowed stepping over flames somehow."
  - code_imp: "Cleaned up various variable usage in fire signal procs."
